### What can we do with text analysis?

* Noun phrase extraction
* Part-of-speech tagging
* Sentiment analysis
* Classification (Naive Bayes, Decision Tree)
* Language translation and detection powered by Google Translate
* Tokenization (splitting text into words and sentences)
* Word and phrase frequencies
* Parsing
* n-grams
* Word inflection (pluralization and singularization) and lemmatization
* Spelling correction
* Add new models or languages through extensions
* WordNet integration

> TextBlob stands on the giant shoulders of NLTK and pattern, and plays nicely with both.
