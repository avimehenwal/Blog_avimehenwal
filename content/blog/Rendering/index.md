CGI
: Computer Generated Imagery, totally computers like games

VFX
: live action shot with editing/computer generated EFFECT

SFX
: sound Effects, explosions, mechanical robots, rains

FX
: All Digital effects generated by computer

MESH
: collection of vertices, edges and faces

TEXTURE
: the feel, appearance, or consistency of a surface or a substance.

RIGGING
: going from static models to animated characters
* Act of assigning relationships b/w objects so that moving one thing will move another

ART
: something which stirs/arouses (good) emotions in you, touches heart
* could be visual like painting, sculptures
* could be auditorial, like music
* could be a mixture like movie, animation
* standup comedy, theatre, live performances
* About your personal experience, potential to learn and grow from it, tell a STORY, record history
* when you draw the HEART of something
* [What is GOD?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs_gY1K1AMU) What is ART?

Brainwashing
: Brainwashing is said to reduce its subject's ability to think critically or independently
* Techniques
* Isolation
* Monopolization of perception 

Gaslighting
: brainwashing technique that makes victim lose all self confidence in themselves and question their own sanity

Studio
: a film or television production company.
* a room where an artist, photographer, sculptor, etc. works.

[Pyrotechnics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrotechnics)
: cience and craft of using self-contained and self-sustained exothermic chemical reactions to make heat, light, gas, smoke and/or sound.
* Air Ram - catapult a person as soon as they step on it
* Can wipe the wires easily

> Robyn and [Rand Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robyn_Miller) developed a game called [MYST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst) at home, on mac PC

* blender 2.8
* Learn shorcuts to save time and be efficient

## 3D Animation BASICS

> There is NO belieavable relation between a color and a emotion

1. Where is it used?
   1. 3D printing, VR, games, VFX, animated movies, Architectural animations, still image
2. Modelling - mesh
3. Texture and Materials
4. Lighting
5. Concept of **Open Movies**, [Ton Roosendaal](https://twitter.com/tonroosendaal) (founder of blender)
6. Photo Realistic Images
7. Model and scultp characters
8. Create realistic environments
9. Architecture, fire, smoke, fluid, object simulation
10. Camera Tracking, compositing
11. [Lighting is important](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjEaoINr3zgH9vCr47kSS5W8PEJBNIiwK)
    1.  Direction
        1.  direction creates SHADOWS, and shadows reveal FORMS
        2.  circle or sphere? Shadows are your friends
        3.  Front lighting makes everything flat
        4.  above head light might create shadow uner eyes, and eyes are doors to soul
        5.  Split Lighting, half
        6.  Guide your eyes, with background lighting composition
    2.  Size of lamp in relation to object
        1.  For human photography, use BIG filter lights to remove impoerfections, details
        2.  Custome BIG light, gradient with point light
        3.  **GOLDEN HOUR** is typically one hr after/before sun-rise/set, air particles flatterns the light
            1.  Photo maganizes wont even consider if photos are not shot at dawn/dusk, such a strict rule
    3.  Color of light
        1.  changes mood and feeling of picture
        2.  NAtural light color vs Artificial
        3.  **BLUE HOUR** architectural photography
            1.  1 hr after sun-rise/set
    4.  Redability
        1.  Adequate light
        2.  Object Seperation
            1.  RIM lighting
    5. Emphasis / Composition
       1. Closer the light, larger the falloff and emphasis
       2. Eyes are drawn to contrast, not the light itself

12.Blender Project/Film management using ATTRACT


> ART is the #1 priority and NOT the TOOLS

## 3D Model a sword

* Navigating the plane
* Split/join worspace area
* Orange outline when selected
* MODES
  * Object mode
  * Edit Mode <kbd>TAB</kbd>
* <kbd>g</kbd> GRAB to move around the object
* Create a base mesh
* Extrude and Scale
* Inset Faces
* Wireframes <kbd>z</kbd> in Edit Mode
* Merge everything to centre
* <kbd>F3</kbd> search options
* Edge loops <kbd>alt</kbd> + select
* Scale with perpendiculars <kbd>Alt + S</kbd>
* Duplicate and scale perpendiculars to get interesting shapes
* Bebble to create more circular look
* Camera Ambient setting
* Applying materieal to faces

## 3D Sculpturing

* Brushes

## How to make shot CGI movies?[^1]

* Get animated characters
* Readily made animation packages from online community

## Animation

Keyframes
: snapshot of objects location, rotation and scale at specified point in time

FX

1. Water 
2. Smoke
3. Fire

## How to rig a Skeletal animation?

* <kbd>CTRL + P</kbd> With Automatic Weights
* Create, rig, animate[^3]

## SAMPLE

* Hollywood B-roll shot from avengers infinity war from yt
* Tracking, chroma key, masking
* Composition - new movie clip
* <kbd>ctrl + shift + click</kbd> user viewer mode 
* Make a keying screen, instead of color key to remove entire green screen
  * Generate as a gradient and use it as a keying color
* Galton board design


## How to utilize blender in your production pipeline/ workflow

* Tell stories
* Demonstrate principles of visual effects

> Why do we have 29.97 frames per second?

## Blender

### 3D pipeline

> modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, video editing and 2D animation pipeline.
 
* Viewport Navigation and object selection deselction
  * Perspective, zoom and camera
* <kbd>ctrl + space</kbd> Maximise current window
* <kbd>shit + S</kbd> Pi Menu
* Selecting and setting RENDERER properties
* View Layers and passes. Each scene can have multiple layers (backgrounds and character passses)
* Context **Modifiers** very  powerful
* Transformation - moving, scaling, rotating
  * each operation could be ddone individually on any of the axis
  * Monkey options is used to test materials, lightings, Animation, rigs, texture
* Collections are the foundations of object organization.
  * Background
  * camera
  * characters
* SHading Workspace - node based shaders
* Composition - after effects
  * glow
  * blurr
  * masks
* Modelling
  * Manupulation of
    * vertices
    * edges
    * planes / faces
* Loop cut - create more vertices in your object
* bevel - a slope from the horizontal or vertical in carpentry and stonework; a sloping surface or edge.
  * use with modifier
* Most of the tieme Texturing is done with images
  * like bricked wall texture on sphere
* Procedurally generated Textures
  * generate texture using a methematical formula instead of pixels
* Three point lighting
  * Beautiful lit monkey in blender
* Rendering Engines
  * Eevee - node base, faster for real-time
    * How do we make an material glow? Like a lot!
  * Cycles - more accurate but takes more processing, cpu | gpu
    * Raytracer
    * Sampling
* Rigging
  * parent-child relationship using Constraints
  * Armature ~ skeleton[^4]
  * Object and Bone COnstraints
    * position object relative to its position constraint

  * Rigify - AddOn
  * Rig matching on X axis
  * Align rig to scene origin and then scale  
  * Advanced rigify rig wwith constraints
* Inverse Kinematics
* VErtex groups and weights
* Keyframes - foundations of animation
  * KeyFrame Editors
    * Graph editor
      * view and edit motion curves
    * Dopesheet

    * Timeline
  * How to insert keyframes?
  * Keyframes types
  * Adjust the loop region in timeline
  * **E** Try animating a bouncing ball
  * Add Markers, like to insert an explosion
  * Add music/audio to your animation
* Sculpturing
  * Draw tool - add/subtract volume
  * Clay/ clay strip - circular and rougher look
  * Inflate / Defalte
