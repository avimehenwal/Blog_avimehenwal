## What is Yeast?
Yeasts are eukaryotic single-celled microorganisms classified as members of the fungus kingdom.

### How does yeast work ?
yeast is a fungus that eats SUGAR and produces Co2 and Alcohol as waste.

*How* do we trap Co2 released by yeast?
Gluten - viscoelastic matrix
like bubble gum

### What is fermentation ?

#### baking powder vs baking soda vs yeast
"Baking powder is baking soda mixed with a few extra ingredients, including an acid. When you're baking a recipe that doesn't call for any acids, baking powder provides the rising power of baking soda and takes care of the chemistry part for you. Baking powder is only fully activated by heat, which is why a cake rises in the oven and not on your countertop, the way bread does.

For cakes, muffins, pancakes, or any other baked goods that go straight into the oven without rising, baking soda or baking powder are the way to go. Baking soda (scientific name: sodium bicarbonate) also creates carbon dioxide, and although it doesn't need resting time to start working, it does need acid. Baking soda is great for recipes that have built-in acidic elements, like lemon or buttermilk â€” without them, baking soda leaves behind a distinctive taste.
