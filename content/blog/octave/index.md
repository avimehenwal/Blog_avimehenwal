## GNU Octave

* Built-in plotting and visualization[^1]
* syntax is largely compatible with Matlab
* as a CLI tool or with GUI
* Scientific Programming
  * Numerical Computation
  * Solves Linear and non linear problems
* Written in `C`, `C++` and `fortran` 
  * Uses an interpreter to execute octave scripts

## What is PI?

* Where does it come from?
  * From a circle
  * IF we take the diameter of a circle and bend it to form a arc
  * and try to place it over the circle
  * It will take `3.14....` diameter arcs to complete the circle
  * mathematical prrof to the circumference of circle formula proof

$$ Circumference_{circle} \propto Diameter $$

$$ Diameter_{circle} = 2 * Radius $$

* Linear Algebra
  * Vector Calculus
    * dot product
    * cross product
  * Matrix calculus
    * MAtrix inverse
* Vectorization - using vector calulation instead of caluclation in for loops
* Seeking `help term`
* Random vectors and matrices
* Load data from Files
* The `linspace()` function generates linearly spaced vectors.
* `x = 1:0.1:10` from 1 to 10 in steps of 0.1
* `hold on` prevent newer plot from erasing the older plot and redraw on top of it
*
