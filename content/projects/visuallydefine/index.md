Just another educational website which presents various **German**
[Phrases](https://visuallydefine.com/phrase),
[Words](https://visuallydefine.com/wortschatz/) and
[general quotes](https://visuallydefine.com/quote/)
which I collected and learned when I was learning german (as
  a  matter of fact I still do XD). Learning new language is hard and takes lots
of time and patience.

If you got any ideas how the daunting task of learning a new language could be made
more fun, [do not hesitate to let me know your world changing idea.]({{< relref "contact.md" >}})
Lets try to solve it together.
