## Why use Gantt charts?

Scheduling of tasks and displaying visual progress.
Displays <mark>dependency relationship and schedule status</mark>

+ Effective communication tool
+ East to see and understand
+ Considers tasks parallelism
+ Add daily cost and cumulative costs to task planning
- Don't clearly show the **relationships between tasks**
- Doesnt clearly the show **impact of a task is delayed**
* Gantt charts are sometimes complimentated with **resource histogram**[^1]

## Task Relationship Types aka Dependencies

FS (Finish to Start)
: A task that cannot start before the completion of its preceding task

SS (Start to Start)
: A Task that cannot start until its predecessor starts. Usually these
will start together, however the dependent task may start later.

FF (Finish to Finish)
: A task that is scheduled to finish at the same time as the preceding task.

PDM - Precedence diagram Method
: is a tool for scheduling activities in a project plan
* great to highlight dependencies


Early Start | Activiity | Early Finish
------------|-----------|--------------
Late Start  | #Days     | Late Finish

Forward project pass and backward project pass

CPM - Critical Path Method
: where Early/late start/finish are same
+ if any activity schedule changes, entire project duration will change
