Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

Telemetry
: Data collected by the device is called telemetry. This is the eyes-and-ears data that IoT devices provide to applications. Telemetry is read-only data about the environment, usually collected through sensors.

## Internet of things

The use of network-connected devices, embedded in the physical environment, to improve some existing process or to enable a new scenario not previously possible.

## Challenges

1. Brownfield deployment (legacy infrastructure) means companies will need to confront the task of integrating new devices and technologies into existing networks.
2. Security and compliance
3. IT/OT convergence means enterprise and industrial operations will need to modify and adjust their processes to accommodate IIoT devices and data.

IoT to disrupt the non-technology companies like
* energy
* water
* food

How to deal with streaming data analytics?

data gathering, data ingest, data processing, and data analysis.

* Cloud pub/sub
* cloud dataflow
* BigQuery

## IoT Scenarios

* Logistic company planning to use automated truckes from next year
* IoT network to monitor hallway activity on college hallway
* designing a new pottery kiln
* environmental factors in Hotel, home, industry, factory

##  Things to ponder while designing IoT

* Rate of data generation and arrival
* CAlculate how much data storage you need

## Types of Sensors
