## BeeF[^1]

* Can inject JS to every page
* Hook browser to BeeF
* [Documentation](https://github.com/beefproject/beef/wiki)
* BeEf uses a javascript, hook.js, which when executed by a browser, gives a hook to BeEF. With a hooked browser, similar to metasploit, you have an array of exploits in front of you. Some of them are viewing cookies, browser history to the more sophisticated attacks of getting a shell.
