## SVG web backgrounds

* size could be a problem along with browser compatibility
  * simple svg sizes are near **5KB**

## Free SVG Resources

* [dribbble.com](https://dribbble.com/shots/3892241-FREE-Workspaces)
* [svgbackgrounds](https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/#protruding-squares)

## Inkscape

* written in c++
* Inkscape uses SVG as its native document format, and has the goal of becoming the most fully compliant drawing program for SVG files available in the Open Source community.

The ultimate power tool of Inkscape is the XML editor <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd></kbd>. It displays the entire XML tree of the document, always reflecting its current state. You can edit your drawing and watch the corresponding changes in the XML tree. Moreover, you can edit any text, element, or attribute nodes in the XML editor and see the result on your canvas. This is the best tool imaginable for learning SVG interactively, and it allows you to do tricks that would be impossible with regular editing tools.[^1]
