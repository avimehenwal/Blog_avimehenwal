## Quantum computer

* Uses real gold
* In computers everything is `0` and `1`. [Even all characters you type from keyboard are converted to 0s and 1s](http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html). Like `A` is actually `0100 0001` to computer
* **Quantum Science** is a branch of physics which deals witht hings which are small, isolated and very cold
* Temperature is 10 mili kelvin (room temp 300 K)

### Properties of quantum computer

Superposition
: you canot thell heads or tails when coin is spinning
* superposition of spins

entangled
: somethings connected in someway

interference
: How does headphones cancel noice
* constructiove and destructive interference
* `cubits` of superconduting materials

* Simmulating nature, modelling atomic bonding, orbital overlap
* HOw do we encode in quantum computer?
* Microwaves to manupulate cubit state of superposition and entaglement

* classical computung vs quantum computing
* Quantum computers can break encryption, whichi are based on prime number base (RSA), Shors algorithm[^1]
* Quantum computers are available to use in clouds
