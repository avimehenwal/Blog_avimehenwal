## what are calories?
The [*calorie*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie) is a unit of energy.

{{<info title="Calorie">}}
Amount of energy it would take to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by
one degree Celcius.
</br></br>
Everything we consume has a calorie count, a measure of how much energy the
item stores in its chemical bonds. 
{{</info>}}

Because energy is defined via work, the SI unit for energy is the same as the unit of work â€“ the joule (J), named in honor of James Prescott Joule and his experiments on the mechanical equivalent of heat. In slightly more fundamental terms, 1 joule is equal to 1 newton metre and, in terms of SI base units.

### Types of calories

1. Calories (with capital C) - nutritional calories
2. calories (with small c)

```
1 Calorie = 1,000 calories
          = 4,184 Joules

1 Pound = 3,500 Calories
```

## How many calories do I really need?

`2000` for women and `2500` for men. Based on factorrs like

* Physical activity

### `TDEE` Total Daily Energy Expenditure

* *BMR* Basal Metabolic Rate
   Calories your body needs just to keep you alive.
* *TEF* Thermal Effect Of Food
* *PA* Physical Activity
     
> 
> `TDEE = BMR + TEF + PA`
> 
> ### How do we calculate BMR?
> 
> #### Mifflin-St Jeor Equation
> ```
> BMR = (10 * Weight[Kg]) + (6.25 * height[cms]) + (5 * age[years]) + S
> S = 5 for men
> S = -161 for women
