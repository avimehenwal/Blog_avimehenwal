address lines
: Data inside a computer is accessed by means of metallic conductors called address lines. Each of them carries a bit of information, the same as a data line. A group of address lines is called an address bus.
* related to memory

## How can multimeter help?

1. Measure Current `mA`
2. Measure Voltage `volt`
   1. DC `=`
   2. AC `~`
3. Measure Resistance `ohm`


Electricity[^1]

* current electricity
* Electric Field

## Breadboard

* Dual in-line Package DIP[^2]
* How to power breadboard
* Circuit Schematics
* PCB - Printed Circuit Boards

## Others

* AC / DC wars

## Logic Analyser

> the last decade has seen their usage shifting to serial protocol applications, involving less signal lines, like I2C, SPI or UART.

* parallel system debugging with wide data buses
* triggers
  * Specify the condition under which Logic analyser will start **Acquisition** (data collection)
  * trigger Levels
    * Auto
    * Level A
    * Level B
* Interpreters
  * post-process acquired data
    * like displaying RS232 data as ASCII
    * I2C to show bus transactions with associated addresses and data values
