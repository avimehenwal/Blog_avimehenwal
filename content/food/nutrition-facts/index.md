Science is providing experimentation for **cause & effect**

Vegetables and Fruits should be the center piece of our meal.
Recommended 9 fruits and vegetables each day.

## Most credible nutrition authorities

1. World Health Organization
2. European Food safety Authority

Gut bacteria can create anti-obesity compound from fiber.

  * high - fatty foods
  * low - water, fiber, fruits $ vegetables

Energy density ==(relation) Body weight

## Best way to cook our vegetables

* Microwaving
* Baking
* Frying
* Griddling
* Pressure cooking
* Boiling - **14%** of antioxidants are lost

> nutrients(anti-oxidants) are lost in cooking water

Most vurnable vegetable to cooking is **Bell peppers**. Do try to eat them raw.

* *Vegetables which have no effect on boiling*
  * Artichokes
  * Beetroots
  * Onions

* *Vegetables which become more healthier after cooking*
  * Green beans - except boiling and pressure cooking. Microwaved green beans >> Raw green beans

Our body can detoxify cyanide given suitable Proteins. Cyanide-detoxifying machine

--------|----------
IDEAL   |    4:1
olive oil |  12:1

* Plant-based doctors network
* Eat beans in any way possible, sprouted or boiled.
* **Danger Zone for food**
  * 5-60 degree Celsius is where bacteria grows and thrives

*steamed rice or boiled rice ?*


Tomatoes -> Lycopene

#### Baking Soda

Better use **Apple Cider Vinegar**

Spinach - minced to increase carotene level
Consume as pesto.
Vurnable to cooking
*How to consume ?*
Spinach basil pesto sauce

## Lutein - brain anti-oxident

* tissue behind eye. For better vision.
* seems to have a relation to cognition
* Daily supplement of **L + Z** for 30 days improves cognition

Eating food slowly makes you feel more satiated

{{< warning title="Eating Rate" >}}
Liquid foods or foods that can be eaten quickly undermine our body's capacity to regulate food intake at healthy levels.

Berry smoothie prior and after EIMD exercise-induced muscle damage accelerates recovery of muscle peak isometric strength.

Sour foods (smoothie) can erode enamel on out teeth. Same damage to enamel as cause by coke.
*How to counter this ?*
use straw

Not all Green leaves are good!
Avoid
* Tobacco leaves
* Cannabis
* 1 Marijuana joint = entire pack of cigarette :: cancer perspective


Cooking tomatoes boost **Lycopene**

### Balsamic Vinegar

Make food leave the stomach longer. Which is good, makes us feel full for longer period of time.

{{< figure src="vinegar-in-food.png" title="2 table spoon vinegar each meal" >}}

Consume apples raw, do not puree or juice
{{< figure src="apples-blended-vs-raw.png" title="Raw apples versus appple juice nutrient value" >}}


Blended **berries** are better

Even if you have to consume pesticide contaminated food, their benefits outweigh the risks even if you cannot find organic options.

Balsamic vinegar (Italian: aceto balsamico), occasionally shortened to balsamic, is a very dark, concentrated, and intensely flavored vinegar originating in Italy, made wholly or partially from grape must. Grape must is freshly crushed grape juice with all the skins, seeds and stems.

A purée (or mash) is cooked food, usually vegetables, fruits or legumes, that has been ground, pressed, blended or sieved to the consistency of a creamy paste or liquid.[1] Purées of specific foods are often known by specific names, e.g., applesauce or hummus.

Barbecue can refer to the cooking method itself.
Barbecuing techniques include smoking, roasting or baking, braising and grilling. The technique for which it is named involves cooking using smoke at low temperatures and long cooking times (several hours). Baking uses an oven to convection cook with moderate temperatures for an average cooking time of about an hour. Braising combines direct, dry heat charbroiling on a ribbed surface with a broth-filled pot for moist heat. Grilling is done over direct, dry heat, usually over a hot fire for a few minutes.

Cooking is just Thermodynamics and chemistry, but tastier.

#### Fats
{{< figure src="saturated-unsaturated-fats-molecular-config.jpg" title="molecular difference between saturated and unsaturated fat" >}}

saturated fats :: all C atoms are bonded to H atom
unsaturated fats :: some C atom bind to each other
usually liquid at room temperature
    Mono unsaturated fat
    Poly unsaturated fat
      Essential fatty acids
      Omega 3
      Omega 6

{{< figure src="unsaturated-fat.png" title="Unsaturated fat molecular backbone" >}}

trans fats:: are the worst. Increases bad cholestrol and decreases the good
