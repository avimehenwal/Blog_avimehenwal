## Accounting

A student buys a computer for **$900**. To pay for the computer, the student uses **$400** in cash and borrows **$500** for the remainder.
Now his **assets** are worth $900,
**liabilities** are $500, and **equity** $400.

[capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics))
: In economics, capital consists of assets that can enhance one's power to perform economically useful work

Liability
: future sacrifices of economic benefits that the entity is obliged to make to other entities as a result of past transactions or other past events

[Asset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset)
: is any resource owned by the business.
* Anything tangible or intangible that can be owned or controlled.
* assets are recorded on the left-hand side (debit) of asset accounts,

[Equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance))
: For example, if someone owns a car worth $15,000 (an asset), but owes $5,000 on a loan against that car (a liability), the car represents $10,000 of equity.
* Equity can be negative if liabilities exceed assets.

[Shareholder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder)
: legally owns one or more shares of stock in a public or private corporation.
* Legally, a person is not a shareholder in a corporation until their name and other details are entered in the corporation's register of shareholders or members.[

[Debits and Credits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debits_and_credits)
: In double entry bookkeeping, debits and credits (abbreviated Dr and Cr, respectively) are entries made in account ledgers to record changes in value resulting from business transactions
* The words debit and credit can sometimes be confusing because they depend on the point of view from which a transaction is observed.

[Dividend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend)
: A dividend is a payment made by a corporation to its shareholders, usually as a distribution of profits.
