> Why care about commit message anyways? What's the need?

We write commit message to get a glance of development activity. Hence writing Awesome commit message might mean people scouring through git logs would be able to undestand development activity better and faster.

Here are some tips to write awesome git commit messages.

* Use present tense: "add awesome-package", not "added ..."
* Use preceding subsystem when applicable: "registry: add theme foobar"
* 50 characters or less for the first line of your commit
* Use of emoji is free[^1]
