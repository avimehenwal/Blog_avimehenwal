Scheduling of tasks

+ Effective communication tool
+ East to see and understand
+ Add daily cost and cumulative costs to task planning 
- Don't clearly show the relationships between tasks
- Doesnt clearly the show impact if a task is delayed
* Gantt charts are sometimes complimentated with resource histogram[^1]

### Task Relationship Types  aka Dependencies

FS (Finish to Start)
: A task that cannot start before the completion of its preceding task

SS (Start to Start)
: A Task that cannot start until its predecessor starts. Usually these
will start together, however the dependent task may start later.

FF (Finish to Finish)
: A task that is scheduled to finish at the same time as the preceding task.

PDM - Precedence diagram Method
: is a tool for scheduling activities in a project plan
* great to highlight dependencies


Early Start | Activiity | Early Finish
------------|-----------|--------------
Late Start  | #Days     | Late Finish

Forward project pass and backward project pass

CPM - Critical Path Method
: where Early/late start/finish are same
+ if any activity schedule changes, entire project duration will change
