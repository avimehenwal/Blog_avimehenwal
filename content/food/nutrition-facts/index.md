Science is providing experimentation for **cause & effect**

Vegitables and Fruits should be the centre piece of our meal.
Recommendad 9 fruits and vegitables each day.

Most creadible nutrition authorities
1. World Health Organization
2. European Food safety Authority

Gut bacteria can create anti-obesity compund from fibre.

Energy Density
    high:: fatty foods
    low:: water, fibre, fruits $ vegitables

Energy density ==(relation) Body weight

Best way to cook our vegitables

* Microwaving
* Baking
* Frying
* Griddling
* Pressure cooking
* Boiling - 14% of antioxidants are lost

nutrients(anit-oxidants) are lost in cooking water

Most vurnable vegitable to cooking is **Bell peppers**. Do try to eat them raw.

*Vegitables which have no effect on boiling*

* Artichokes
* Beatroot
* Onions

*Vegitables which become more healthier after cooking*

* Green beans - except boiling and pressure cooking. Microwaved green beans >> Raw green beans
* Carrots
* Celery

Plant-based doctors network

Eat beans in any way possible, sprouted or boiled.

**Danger Zone for food**

5-60 degree Celcius is where bacteria grows and thrives

*steamed rice or boiled rice ?*


Tomatoes -> Lycopene

#### Baking Soda

Better use **Apple Cider Vinegar**

Spinache - minced to increasee carotene level
Consume as pesto.
Vurnable to cooking
*How to consume ?*
Spinache basil pesto sauce

## Lutein - brain anti-oxident

* tissue behind eye. For better vision.
* seems to have a relation to cognition
* Daily suppliment of **L + Z** for 30 days imporoves cognition
*

Eating food slowly makes you feel more satieted

{{< figure src="food-eating-rate.png" title="Eating rate for various foods" >}}

{{< warning title="Eating Rate" >}}
Liquid foods or foods that can be eaten quickly undermine our body's capacity to regulate food intake at healthy levels.

Berry smoothie prior and after EIMD exercise-induced muscle damage acclerates recovery of muscle peak isometric strength.

Sour foods (smoothie) can erode enamel on out teeth. Same damage to enamel as cause by coke.
*How to counter this ?*
use straw

Not all Green leaves are good!
Avoid
* Toabcco leaves
* Cannabis
* 1 Marijuana joint = entire pack of ciggerett :: cancer perspective


Cooking tomatoe boost **Lycopene**

### Balsamic Vinegar 
Make food leave the stomach longer. Which is good, makes us feel full for longer period of time.

{{< figure src="vinegar-in-food.png" title="2 table spoon vinegar each meal" >}}

Consume apples raw, do not puree or juice
{{< figure src="apples-blended-vs-raw.png" title="Raw apples versus appple juice nutrient value" >}}


Blended **berries** are better

Even if you have to consume pesticide contaiminated food, thier benefits outweigh the risks even if you cannot find organic options.

Balsamic vinegar (Italian: aceto balsamico), occasionally shortened to balsamic, is a very dark, concentrated, and intensely flavoured vinegar originating in Italy, made wholly or partially from grape must. Grape must is freshly crushed grape juice with all the skins, seeds and stems.

A purée (or mash) is cooked food, usually vegetables, fruits or legumes, that has been ground, pressed, blended or sieved to the consistency of a creamy paste or liquid.[1] Purées of specific foods are often known by specific names, e.g., applesauce or hummus.

Barbecue can refer to the cooking method itself.
Barbecuing techniques include smoking, roasting or baking, braising and grilling. The technique for which it is named involves cooking using smoke at low temperatures and long cooking times (several hours). Baking uses an oven to convection cook with moderate temperatures for an average cooking time of about an hour. Braising combines direct, dry heat charbroiling on a ribbed surface with a broth-filled pot for moist heat. Grilling is done over direct, dry heat, usually over a hot fire for a few minutes.

Cooking is just Thermodynamics and chemistry, but tastier.

#### Fats
{{< figure src="saturated-unsaturated-fats-molecular-config.jpg" title="molecular difference between saturated and unsaturated fat" >}}

saturated fats :: all C atoms are bonded to H atom
unsaturated fats :: some C atom bind to each other
usually liquid at room temperature
    Mono unsaturated fat
    Poly unsaturated fat
      Essential fatty acids
      Omega 3
      Omega 6

{{< figure src="unsaturated-fat.png" title="Unsaturated fat molecular backbone" >}}

trans fats:: are the worst. Increases bad cholestrol and decreases the good
