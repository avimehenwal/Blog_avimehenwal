CGI
: Computer Generated Imagery, totally computers like games

VFX
: live action shot with editing/computer generated EFFECT

SFX
: sound Effects, explosions, mechanical robots, rains

FX
: All Digital effects generated by computer

MESH
: collection of vertices, edges and faces

TEXTURE
: the feel, appearance, or consistency of a surface or a substance.

RIGGING
: going from static models to animated characters
* Act of assigning relationships b/w objects so that moving one thing will move another

* blender 2.8
* Learn shorcuts to save time and be efficient

## 3D Model a sword

* Navigating the plane
* Split/join worspace area
* Orange outline when selected
* MODES
  * Object mode
  * Edit Mode <kbd>TAB</kbd>
* <kbd>g</kbd> GRAB to move around the object
* Create a base mesh
* Extrude and Scale
* Inset Faces
* Wireframes <kbd>z</kbd> in Edit Mode
* Merge everything to centre
* <kbd>F3</kbd> search options
* Edge loops <kbd>alt</kbd> + select
* Scale with perpendiculars <kbd>Alt + S</kbd>
* Duplicate and scale perpendiculars to get interesting shapes
* Bebble to create more circular look
* Camera Ambient setting
* Applying materieal to faces

## 3D Sculpturing

* Brushes

## How to make shot CGI movies?[^1]

* Get animated characters
* Readily made animation packages from online community

## Animation

Keyframes
: snapshot of objects location, rotation and scale at specified point in time

FX

1. Water 
2. Smoke
3. Fire

## How to rig a Skeletal animation?

* <kbd>CTRL + P</kbd> With Automatic Weights
* Create, rig, animate[^3]

## SAMPLE

* Hollywood B-roll shot from avengers infinity war from yt
* Tracking, chroma key, masking
* Composition - new movie clip
* <kbd>ctrl + shift + click</kbd> user viewer mode 
* Make a keying screen, instead of color key to remove entire green screen
  * Generate as a gradient and use it as a keying color
* Galton board design


## How to utilize blender in your production pipeline/ workflow

* Tell stories
* Demonstrate principles of visual effects

> Why do we have 29.97 frames per second?

## Blender

### 3D pipeline

> modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, video editing and 2D animation pipeline.
 
* Viewport Navigation and object selection deselction
  * Perspective, zoom and camera
* <kbd>ctrl + space</kbd> Maximise current window
* <kbd>shit + S</kbd> Pi Menu
* Selecting and setting RENDERER properties
* View Layers and passes. Each scene can have multiple layers (backgrounds and character passses)
* Context **Modifiers** very  powerful
* Transformation - moving, scaling, rotating
  * each operation could be ddone individually on any of the axis
  * Monkey options is used to test materials, lightings, Animation, rigs, texture
* Collections are the foundations of object organization.
  * Background
  * camera
  * characters
* SHading Workspace - node based shaders
* Composition - after effects
  * glow
  * blurr
  * masks
* Modelling
  * Manupulation of
    * vertices
    * edges
    * planes / faces
* Loop cut - create more vertices in your object
* bevel - a slope from the horizontal or vertical in carpentry and stonework; a sloping surface or edge.
  * use with modifier
* Most of the tieme Texturing is done with images
  * like bricked wall texture on sphere
* Procedurally generated Textures
  * generate texture using a methematical formula instead of pixels
* Three point lighting
  * Beautiful lit monkey in blender
* Rendering Engines
  * Eevee - node base, faster for real-time
    * How do we make an material glow? Like a lot!
  * Cycles - more accurate but takes more processing, cpu | gpu
    * Sampling
* Rigging
  * parent-child relationship using Constraints
  * Armature ~ skeleton[^4]
