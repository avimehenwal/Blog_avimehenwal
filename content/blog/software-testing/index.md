## Test Case

### Good test case

> How can you make your ATC scalable for future?
> How can you make tests more scalable than they already are? 

* Avoid dependencies b/w tests
  * VAlids login, change password, then Login with new password
* move LOGIC to LIBRARY KEYWORD
* Creating NEW Tc should be easy using context Keywords
* One TC should test **only** one thing
* single level of abstraction principle
* Use `polling` instead of `waits`
* Remove incidental details from TC[^1]
* Workflow test-cases
  * Precondition
  * Action
  * Verification
  * Cleanup
* Data-driven tests
  * One high-level keyword per test

## Software Testers to look upto
