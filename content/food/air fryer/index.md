# Air Frying
[Is a cooking method](#references) by circulating hot air around the food using the convection mechanism. A mechanical fan circulates the hot air around the food at high speed, cooking the food and producing a crispy layer via browning reactions of two kinds.

## Dough Recipe

half cup water to one and quarter cup flour.
Knead for 1 minute only in mixer
else use hands
Dont screw up with gluten consitency
2 cups wheat : 3/4 cup water

tawa could be at 205-345 degree C

slow cooking - develop the crust overtime

For airfryer/ baking use **Pastry** dough rather than Indian dough


ice cold water to water butter cold in pastry mixture

kneading the dough develops Gluten

In cold water, the gluten chains are more able to "stretch out" ... Hot water makes the gluten molecules form more of a "ball" shape

Cooking chickpeas the scientific way
    chickpeas are dry from inside
    add tea bag and baking soda at the same time

* Vegan custard sauce recipe
  * cornstarch + vegan milk + maple syrup
* Cauliflower manchurian

self rising flour
    Regular flour + baking powder + salt


### Problems

Drying out before they are cooked.
    use high heat

Denser the vegitables, smaller the cuts

above 250 is roasting, anything below that is baking
