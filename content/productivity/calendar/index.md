## Difference between event, task and reminder?

{{< warning >}}
<br>
1. unable to convert task to Gcal event.<br>
2. Task doent have a end time
{{< /warning >}}

Until a reminder is completed, users will be notified of the task by a message displayed on top of Google Calendar.
Once the user has finished the task, the reminder can be swiped away from notification area.
If you feel that this is a bit irritating then you can set the Reminder to a later time, similar to Events.
