# What is Longevity

[As per Wikipedia, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity)
the word "longevity" is sometimes used as a synonym for "life expectancy" in demography. However, the term longevity is sometimes meant to refer only to especially long-lived members of a population, whereas life expectancy is always defined statistically as the average number of years remaining at a given age. For example, a population's life expectancy at birth is the same as the average age at death for all people born in the same year (in the case of cohorts). Longevity is best thought of as a term for general audiences meaning 'typical length of life' and specific statistical definitions should be clarified when necessary.


### Why even care for it? Is it important?

We are on this planet for a very short period of time. If you think you
do some good while you are here, you might want to consider the
options to prolong your existence on earth.

**Sirtuin** proteins can help in longetivity. Responsible for DNA repair

people curing cancer on 21 day fast.

There are several thousand types of bacteria inside your gut. You goal
should be to feed the *good bacteria* and starve the *bad bacteria*.
Our gut in itself is a community of micro-organisms.

# Food choices

{{< figure src="food-spending-in-countries.png" title="People expenditure on food based on different counteries" >}}

## What is the best diet for humans?
Just like cats, dogs and any other mammal, there is a best diet for humans. For humans its one one which is **plant based** and almost all calories coming from 4 principle *food groups*

1. Fruits
2. Vegitables
3. Whole grains
4. Legumes

low in **fat** high in **fibre**

As the numbre of queens and kings and priests and priesteses have increased in the world, so are the heart diseases.

### Whats the fuss about Proteins?

{{<quote author="Dr. Micheal Greger">}}
    Its almost impossible to design a protein deficient diet.
{{</quote>}}

All the animals we eat for proteins are *Vegitarians*. Where is the logic in that!

Apart from promoting muscle growth and immunity functions, excess of proteins also lead to *high blood pressure*

### Is some type of meat like white meat better tha other type like *redmeat* ?

Stop and think for a second, what is meat? They are muscles and organs of animals. They all are the same

- high fat
- high protein
- high cholestrol
- high in **Food Chain** and
- No food fibre

### What about Calcium? Should not dairy products be calcium rich?

{{<info title="Calcium myth">}}
    Small Orange has ~40 milligrams of Calcium. <br>
    And we need 500-1200 mg per day.

#### What is Milk?

Cow millk is for baby-cows, not for adults of another species.
Its a cocktail of growth-hormones, lard and fat to fasten the growth of baby animal. Its similar to a **liquid meat**

### Fatty Acids
Our body needs **Omega 3** and **Omega 6**, rest all fats could be synthesised by body from plant based foods.


| Soures of Omega 3 | Sources of Omega 6 |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Walnuts           | meat products |
| Flax seeds        | Poly unsaturated vegitable oils |
| Soy               | |


Ration between Omega3:Omega6 **1:3**. But its 1:25 based on normal american diet. Instead of bringing up Omega3 contents using suppliments, try reducing the Omega6 intake.

### Why are there obese Vegitarians?
They haven't given up the **Vegitable oil**.

    and thy medicine be thy Food.

All the nutrients that we need are in food. And they are present in very complex combinations that we do not understand fully yet. Suppliments extract a specific compund and overload it on the consumer.

### Organic vs non-organic food ?

70% of the US arable land is used to grow crops for animals, and not humans.
