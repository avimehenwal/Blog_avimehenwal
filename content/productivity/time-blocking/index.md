## Why use it?

Also know as **calendar Blocking** or **time boxing**. Practise of blocking you next day you main events/tasks
you want to accomplish that day. Makes you think about a TIME you have left and THINGS you want to do.

* Plans with ALWAYS change, be prepared for adjustments
* Plan ahead approach
* 3 Priorities each day
* Ideal Day template
* But might have to make adjustments in reality Journal
* Measure you time.
* TIME is your most important resource
* Take analytics on it.
* Planning times vs Executing time
* Model your week
* Recurring tasks at same day, same task. To strengthen **HABIT**
* Start filling with your important things first.
* Logs to look back in time and find out exactly when you did worked on a task.

## Why is it effective

* Takes the choice out of the equation
* Planning Fallacies, we human beings are not good at estimating things


## People to look upto?

### Elon Musk

He switches time between Projects Tesla, spaceX, OpenAI and time to time between `Boring COmpany` and `Flamethrowers`.

## How to time-block?

1. start with writing habits/tasks you would like to do in a day or everyday.
2. HOw much time do you have avialble
3. Adjust and match task in your available time-line
4. Dont forget to adjust if something doesnt work, because it wont XD

## Whats wrong using Goole tasks and calendar

* Have 2 way integration
* Can strike Tasks Off when completed, canot do that with tasks coming from todoist!
* Create recurring tasks

### Issues

1. google tasks not showing in calendar app? Unable to open on web, redirects to app!
2. Use emojis on ubuntu usinf `GNOME characters`. Of use android mobile while entering

Measurable
: quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
Assignable
: specify who will do it.
Realistic
: state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.
Time-related
: specify when the result(s) can be achieved.
