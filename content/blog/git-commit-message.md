> Why care about commit message anyways? What's the need?


We write commit message to get a glance of development activity. Hence writing Awesome commit message might mean people scouring through git logs would be able to understand development activity better and faster.

## some tips to write awesome git commit messages.

1. Use present tense: **add awesome-package**, not **added ...**
2. Use preceding subsystem when applicable: **registry: add theme foobar**
3. 50 characters or less for the first line of your commit
4. Use of emoji is free[^1]

#### Examples of well crafted repositories

While many repositoriesâ€™ logs look like the former, there are exceptions. The Linux kernel and Git itself are great examples. Look at Spring Boot, or any repository managed by Tim Pope.

## git staged | unstaged files

Even after `git add`ing your files and later changing them, git may again ask you to stage
your files! Why is that?

when you change a file which is already in the repository, you have to git add it <mark>again</mark> if you want it to be staged.

This allows you to commit only a subset of the changes you made since the last commit. For example, let's say you have file a, file b and file c. You modify file a and file b but the changes are very different in nature and you don't want all of them to be in one single commit. You issue

```
git add a
git commit file_a -m "bugfix, in a"
git add b
git commit file_b -m "new feature, in b"

# if you want to commit everything you can just type
git commit -a
```

  Add a precommit hook to stage files for commit. Have a abbr already created for it,
  just call it before commit.
{{% /note %}}

### How to unstage a file?

`git rm --cached <filePath>` does not unstage a file, it actually **stages the removal of the file(s) from the repo** (assuming it was already committed before) but leaves the file in your working tree (leaving you with an untracked file). **will unstage the file for future commits also**. It's unstaged until it gets added again with git add <file>.

`git reset -- <filePath>` will **unstages the file in the current commit.**
