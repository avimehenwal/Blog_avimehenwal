### How does it work?

* **Pancreas** is located below the left rib-cage.
* It has alpha, beta and delta cells
* Beta cells in Pancreas makes [Insulin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin)


### functions of Insulin

1. Lowers sugar
2. affects fats and proteins and hence the overall Metabolism
3. Insulin converts sugar to **Cholestrol** and *triglycerides* (blood fat). Which increases tension in arteries and increases *Blood Pressure*
4. retains sodium
5. Drives proteins / amino acids into cells
   
### Insulin Spike

* is triggered by *Carbohydrates*
  * [Bread + Sugar] = Glycogen + Fat
* may lead to **Insulin Resistance** or *Fatty Liver*

### What causes Insulin Resistance

1. Excessive sugars
2. some proteins
3. Estrogen (women growing fatter after pregnency)

### Insulin Resistance symptoms

* bad vision specially in low light
* Brain Fogs

### How to lower insulin?

* Apple cider vinegar ACV
* Fermented food like sauerkraut
* Vegitables
* Fibre
* Pure fats (satiety longer without having to eat + no insulin)
* Sleep and Exercise
